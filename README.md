You are to create a card game for 4 players.

The players each draw a card from the deck each round.

The player who draws the highest card will win the round and score a point.

A 2 3, J Q K spade > hearts > club > diamonds 

When there are no more cards left in the deck, the game should end with a scoreboard that displays the players ranked in order of the total number of points they have scored.

The product team is impressed with your product and takes it to market for initial validation. They return with a list of revisions they would like to make:

They would like more than 4 players in the game.

All players who draw the card must now show the card.

Subsequent players are allowed to skip the round.

There are now two decks of playing cards available per game

How would you update your implementation to accommodate these features?
